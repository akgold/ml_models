This repository is going to host code for building custom machine learning models so I can make sure I really understand the details of those models. I'll be working somewhat from ESL. 

Currently Implemented:
* OLS
* Forward Stepwise Regression (but not usefully...)

Models I want to build:

* Neural Network
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines
* Tree algorithms
